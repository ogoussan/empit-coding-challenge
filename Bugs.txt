Bugs
- Wrong order of countries (not in alphabetical order)
- Polygon stays selected even when coresponding country or continent is no longer selected (not sure if it is a bug)
- Autocomplete can't handle every polygon and causes the site to freeze for a few seconds

Improvement
- display selected option in field
- scroll to zoom in and out
- map should fill entire width and height of window
